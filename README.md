Geo-caching Photo game -- sets pins in your area; a Google Street View picture of where the pin is will be displayed to you. Take a picture similar enough to the Street View picture to earn points! 




## Dev Notes 

Original idea was conceived by my friend Monica Xu (https://github.com/mokaixu) for a hackathon; you can find our original hackathon repository here: (https://github.com/alan-yilun-li/pennapps-xvi). 

I built the iOS app, using Swift and Apple's native libraries (Cocoa-touch, MapKit) and implemented the Google Street View access. Monica built a wrapper server streamlining access to the public computer vision API we used for image comparison.

This repo is my continuation of the project.
